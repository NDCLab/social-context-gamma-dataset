# social-context-gamma-dataset

## Project Goal
This study investigates relations between performance on tasks and mental health. It involves questionnaires, computer tasks, and engaging in other tasks that are similar to things you do every day.


## Background & Design
Broadly, this study aims to clarify relations between performance on tasks and mental health. It involves completing questionnaires, performing computer tasks, and engaging in other tasks that are similar to things you do every day, during which audio/video may be recorded. You may also be invited to (optionally) participate in additional follow-up studies for credit. The information gained from this study may enhance the scientific understanding of cognition and mental health. This study involves understanding of Multi-EF task development in investigating the possible influnces of faces on computer task performances.
